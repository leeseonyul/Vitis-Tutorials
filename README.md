## </br>Unlocking a new design experience for all developers </br>모든 개발자들을 위한 새로운 설계 경험 제공

The Vitis&trade; unified software platform enables the development of embedded software and accelerated applications on heterogeneous Xilinx&reg; platforms including FPGAs, SoCs, and Versal ACAPs. It provides a unified programming model for accelerating Edge, Cloud, and Hybrid computing applications.
</br>Vities&trade; 통합 소프트웨어 플랫폼은 FPGA, SoC, Versal ACAP를 포함한 이종 Xilinx&reg; 플랫폼에서 임베디드 소프트웨어 및 가속된 애플리케이션을 개발할 수 있다. 엣지, 클라우드, 하이브리드 컴퓨팅 애플리케이션의 가속화를 위한 통한 프로그래밍 모델을 제공한다.

Leverage integration with high-level frameworks, develop in C, C++, or Python using accelerated libraries or use RTL-based accelerators & low-level runtime APIs for more fine-grained control over implementation — Choose the level of abstraction you need.

</p>

### [Getting Started](./Getting_Started)

Start here! Learn the basics of the Vitis programming model by putting together your very first application. No experience necessary!

### [Acceleration Tutorial](./Hardware_Acceleration)

Learn how to use the Vitis core development kit to build, analyze, and optimize an accelerated algorithm developed in C++, OpenCL, and even low-level hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL.

Learn how to use Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS), compiler, analyzer, and debugger to identify performance bottlenecks and make modifications to increase algorithm efficiency and performance using an Alveo&trade; Data Center acceleration card.

### [AI Engine Development](./AI_Engine_Development)

Learn how to use the Vitis core tools to develop for Versal&trade;, the first Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) device from Xilinx.

Learn how to target, develop, and deploy advance algorithms using Versal's AI Engine array in conjunction with PL IP/kernels and software applications running on the embedded processors.


### [Platform Creation Tutorial](./Vitis_Platform_Creation)

Learn how to build custom platforms for Vitis to target your own boards, and how to modify and extend existing platforms.

Learn how to configure the platform hardware sources, construct the runtime software environment, add support for software and
hardware emulation, and more.

## Other Vitis Tutorial Repositories

### [Machine Learning Tutorial](https://github.com/xilinx/Vitis-AI-Tutorials) 

Learn how to use Vitis, Vitis AI, and the Vitis accelerated libraries to implement a fully end-to-end accelerated application using purely software-defined flows - no hardware expertise required.

Use Vitis AI to configure Xilinx hardware using the Tensorflow framework. Vitis AI allows the user to quantize, compile, and deploy an inference model in a matter of minutes.

### [Embedded Design Tutorials](http://xilinx.github.io/Embedded-Design-Tutorials)

Learn how to build and use embedded operating systems and drivers on Xilinx Adaptive SoCs and the MicroBlaze™ soft processor. These tutorials cover open-source operating systems and bare metal drivers available from Xilinx, compilers, debuggers, and profiling tools for traditional SoC software development.
